## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter** – native GUI library
- **MySQL** – backend user data storage
- **SQLite** – backend user data storage if you don't have or want to use **mysql**
- **mysql-connector-python** – for Python-MySQL communication

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Option 1: Run Executable (Recommended for Non-Developers)

No installation needed—just download and run the appropriate .exe file:

- Final_password_UTK_sqlite.exe – Uses SQLite (no setup required)
- Password_UTK_mysql.exe – Requires MySQL installed and configured

💡 Use the SQLite version if you don’t have MySQL or prefer a simpler setup. 

### Option 2: Run Python Script (For Developers)

#### 🔧 Prerequisites


- Python 3.7+
- MySQL server (Only for MYSQL version)

#### 📥 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/No1Gaurav/Tkinter-python.git
cd Tkinter-python
```
```bash
# For SQLite
python src/sqlite_app.py

# For MySQL
python src/mysql_app.py

```
